            Hi all! Gargi Chaturvedi this side! 
            <br>
            I am the creator of the Origami Designs and Tutorials Website.
            <br>
            I am a student and I have created this site as a project for a programming course that I am taking from WhiteHat Jr.
            <br>
            I have provided guidance for 5 origami creations and will provide more in future as well.
            <br>
            The image is linked to my portfolio. Do have a look at it.
            <br>
            <b>Happy Origami.</b>
        </p>

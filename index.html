        <p>These are some interesting facts about rabbits: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A baby rabbit is called a kit, a female is called a doe and a male is called a buck.</li>
            <li>A rabbit’s teeth never stop growing! Instead, they’re gradually worn down as the rabbit chews on grasses, wildflowers and vegetables — meaning they never get too long.</li>
            <li>Rabbits perform an athletic leap, known as a ‘binky‘, when they’re happy — performing twists and kicks in mid air.</li>
            <li>Rabbits can jump as high as 90 centimetres in one leap.</li>
            <li>Growing up to 10 centimetres in length, rabbits can turn their ears by 180 degrees, keeping a careful listen out for predators.</li>
        </ul>
